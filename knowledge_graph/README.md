# Knowledge Graph

Build a knowledge graph with the following tools:
- BentoML service API to publish an API that serves embeddings
- Custom Neo4J to store the knowledge graph & embedding
- BentoML service API to publish the LLM Chatbot

## Langchain example
- https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/knowledge-graphs-rag/lesson/8/chatting-with-the-knowledge-graph
Use the https://haystack.deepset.ai/integrations/neo4j-document-store dynamic document retriever + the LLM to
generate the best cypher query first?
